## Use any editor, I personally prefer Visual Studio Code:

1) Please enter your branch before you decide to make changes!
   There are 3 branches: Home Page, Personal Profile, Artists/Venue

2) Please keep edits to your folder! Makes merging much more easier to not have conflicts.
  
3) If you're using Visual Studio Code, I'd highly suggest getting this plug-in to view your changes live-time without needing to refresh on your device everytime.
   Name: HTML Preview : https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tht13.html-preview-vscode
   { After installation, right click on your HTML file
   <img width="1278" height="790" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/288b67a4-fc7c-427c-9bf6-9df447dd7ffb" />
   You should see an option saying "Show Preview" where it'll pop up a side window where you can view your changes live-time. }

4) Happy SLP! Don't be afraid to ask any questions.
